# palette

Little javascript app based on AngularJS, to generate palettes of colors from a level between 0 and 255. The level value is the average value between red, green and blue. The algorith is quite simplist, and don't allow to get deep colors.

## How to use it?

No SCSS, no uglyfier, no grunt... I told you it's a small repo. Open the index.html in your browser and you're done. Even the AngularJS library is included.
